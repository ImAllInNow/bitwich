# BITWICH
BITWICH is a simple dApp to fill the gap between retail and exchange prices of some ERC-20 tokens. Supported tokens are sold in small amounts at a retail price on the company's website. They are also available on public exchanges for much less cost, but the higher cashout fees and minimum purchase limits result in a higher cost of obtaining a small amount of the tokens.

BITWICH fills this gap by selling small amounts of tokens for lower than retail price. Also, after selling some tokens, BITWICH will buy back that same amount for more than exchange price. This allows BITWICH to be self sustaining.
